## 🧐 Why This Project?

College students often struggle to find specific information buried in lengthy policy documents, rulebooks, and scattered PDF files. Questions like:

- *"What's the minimum attendance to sit for exams?"*
- *"What CGPA do I need for placements?"*
- *"How do I apply for a scholarship?"*
- *"What are the hostel mess timings?"*

...usually require digging through multiple documents or asking seniors who may not have accurate answers.

**This project solves that.** It ingests official college documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT) into a vector database, and uses a locally-running LLM to answer student questions in natural, conversational language — with source citations so students can verify the information.

### 🎯 Key Goals

- **Accessibility**: Students get instant, accurate answers without reading 50-page PDFs
- **Privacy**: Everything runs locally — no data sent to OpenAI or any cloud service
- **Student-friendly**: Understands slang, abbreviations, and informal language (e.g., "idk", "uk", "wanna")
- **Trustworthy**: Every answer comes with source document citations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm**
- **Ollama** installed and running ([install guide](https://ollama.ai/download))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohitGoel109/LLM-Based-Knowledge-Retrieval-System.git
cd LLM-Based-Knowledge-Retrieval-System
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Pull the LLM Model

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

### 4. Add Your Documents

Place your college PDF, DOCX, or TXT files in the `data/` directory. Sample files are provided to get started.

### 5. Ingest Documents into Vector DB

```bash
python ingest.py
```

This converts your documents into vector embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB.

### 6. Start the Backend

```bash
python api.py
# Server starts at http://localhost:8000
```

### 7. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd web-app
npm install
npx vite --port 5173
# Opens at http://localhost:5173
```

### Alternative: Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

```

1. **Student asks a question** (possibly with slang like "idk about the attendance rules")
2. **Slang preprocessing** expands it to "I don't know about the attendance rules"
3. **Vector retrieval** finds the 3 most relevant document chunks from ChromaDB
4. **LLM generates an answer** using only the retrieved context + conversation history
5. **Source citations** are returned so students can verify the information

## 💬 Slang & Abbreviation Support

The system understands common student language:

| Slang | Expands To |
|-------|-----------|
| `uk` | you know |
| `idk` | I don't know |
| `wdym` | what do you mean |
| `tbh` | to be honest |
| `pls` / `plz` | please |
| `wanna` | want to |
| `gonna` | going to |
| `cgpa` | CGPA cumulative grade point average |
| `hod` | Head of Department |
| `kt` | backlog subject |

...and 25+ more. See [`rag_engine.py`](rag_engine.py) for the full list.

## 📄 Sample Data Included

The project comes with 6 realistic sample documents:

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `sample_policy.txt` | Attendance, grading system, library rules, IT lab guidelines |
| `placement_cell_guidelines.txt` | Eligibility criteria, CGPA cutoffs, company visit history, placement stats |
| `hostel_rules.txt` | Timings, mess schedule, room allocation, visitor policy, prohibited items |
| `fee_structure.txt` | Tuition, exam fees, hostel charges, scholarships, refund policy |
| `anti_ragging_policy.txt` | Definitions, punishments, reporting channels, helpline numbers |
| `scholarship_info.txt` | Merit-based, need-based, government, sports scholarships |

> **Note:** These are sample documents for demonstration. Replace them with your actual college documents for production use.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **Offline LLM**: Requires Ollama running locally with sufficient RAM (~4 GB for Llama 3.2 3B)
- **Sample data only**: Real college documents need to be added for actual deployment
- **No authentication**: Currently no user login system — anyone with access can query
- **Single-session memory**: Conversation history resets when the server restarts
- **English only**: The slang dictionary and LLM are optimized for English
- **No document upload UI**: Documents must be manually added to `data/` and re-ingested via CLI

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap / What's Left

- [ ] **Add real college documents** (PDFs from administration)
- [ ] **Document upload via UI** — drag-and-drop documents through the web interface
- [ ] **User authentication** — student login with college roll number
- [ ] **Persistent chat history** — save conversations to a database
- [ ] **Multi-language support** — Hindi + English for broader accessibility
- [ ] **Admin dashboard** — view query analytics, popular questions, system health
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** — optimize the UI for phone screens
- [ ] **Deploy to production** — host on a college server or cloud platform
